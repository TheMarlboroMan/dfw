//!Defines the interface for a controller.

//!Each controller is like a different state of the application, being "menu",
//!"configuration", "pause"... This allows for separation of concerns.
//!All controllers to be used by the application must be registered in the
//!state_driver. Controllers can communicate amongst themselves through
//!the state driver (which has direct access to public methods) and
//!signal broadcasters. Every single one is drawable. The interface is just
//!there to allow the controller_view_manager to focus on its job.
